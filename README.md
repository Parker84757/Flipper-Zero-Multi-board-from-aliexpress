# Flipper-Zero-Multi-board-from-aliexpress
These are some .bin files I was sent by the seller of the board I bought off of Aliexpress. 


So I found it was a major pain in the ass to find any information regarding this seemingly badass looking board. It has esp32, cc1101 amplified module similar to the flux capacitor minus the logic, and a nrf24 module. These are all the files I was able to aquire through hours of scouring the web and reaching out to multiple sellers of the product. There are some .bin files as well as a doc file that explains the process of flashing the board and where to go to do it. I am new at this whole radio frequencies game, as it has amost completely consumed my entire life.... I am skipping work to work on my little projects that I am decided I want to try and take a stab at. If anyone is able to do anything with these files please share your experience with me so I can learn please. Thank you and I hope this will come as a relief to someone that may have been as frustrated as I was in searching for any kind of support for this product that seems pretty legit.
